# Incidents

This section contains all incident reports and post-mortems for the **To Do List** project.

## About Incidents

Use the incident template (`template-incident.md`) to document:

- Critical production issues
- Service outages
- Performance degradations
- Security incidents

Each incident report should include:

- Detailed timeline
- Root cause analysis
- Resolution steps
- Action items and lessons learned

## Creating a New Incident Report

1. Copy `template-incident.md`
2. Rename it with the incident ID and date (e.g., `inc-001-2024-01-15-database-outage.md`)
3. Fill in all sections
4. Use appropriate severity admonitions (:::danger for Critical, :::warning for Major)
